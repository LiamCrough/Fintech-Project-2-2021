Project 2: Machine Learning applications to solve fintech problems.
## The Problem
After a century of computing and the recent proliferation of machine learning algorithms and trading strategies, members of the general public are now experiencing what can be described as a 'data overload'. With hundreds of different strategies existing, the problem today is this... what strategies are the most efficient and which strategies are the most accurate. Is it best to go with a natural language processing approach, statistical arbitrage, linear regression or sentiment analysis?

This is the problem that will hopefully be solved.

## The Solution
In order to combat this problem, various machine learning models will be evaluated and backtested in order to determine which ones would yield the highest returns for the investor, or which ones appear to be more accurate and efficent in predicting price movement trends.
